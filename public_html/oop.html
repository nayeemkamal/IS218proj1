                        <h2>What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?<a class="headerlink"
                                href="#what-is-object-oriented-programming-in-python" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
                        <p>Object-oriented programming is a <a
                                href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm">programming paradigm</a> that
                            provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into
                            individual <strong>objects</strong>.</p>
                        <p>For instance, an object could represent a person with <strong>properties</strong> like a
                            name, age, and address and <strong>behaviors</strong> such as walking, talking, breathing,
                            and running. Or it could represent an <a
                                href="https://realpython.com/python-send-email/">email</a> with properties like a
                            recipient list, subject, and body and behaviors like adding attachments and sending. </p>
                        <p>Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world
                            things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees,
                            students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that
                            have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions.</p>
                        <p>The key takeaway is that objects are at the center of object-oriented programming in Python,
                            not only representing the data, as in procedural programming, but in the overall structure
                            of the program as well.</p>

                    <h2><strong>What is Abstraction?</strong></h2>
                    <p>Do you ever drink Coffee? If you do, then there’s a good chance that you might have used a coffee
                        machine in your life. The concept of abstraction is closely related to the principle of a coffee
                        machine. You know that a coffee machine makes coffee, but you don’t need to know how it makes
                        coffee. In short, all you need to know is about which buttons to press to make Coffee. You can
                        use a button defined interface to make coffee, without needing to worry about the internal
                        working of a machine.</p>
                    <p>The same principle goes into the concept of an Object-oriented programming language. In simple
                        words, it is a concept that is not associated with any particular instance.</p>
                    <p>Consider your method as the coffee machine and your input parameter as the buttons on the
                        machine. Abstraction allows you to create seamless programs by just knowing what method to call
                        and what parameters to input.</p>
                    <p>In our calculator program, we used abstraction to separate the logic of our calculator class and
                        to prevent the user from needing to worry about the history of the program as seen in the
                        history and calculator classes below:</p>
                    <a href="calculator/calc/history/calculations.py">calculations.py</a>
                    <a href="calculator/calc/history/history.py">history.py</a>

                    <p>Rather than have the user worry about the actual data being maintained in the history class, the
                        calculation class allows for the abstraction of the history functionality while providing the
                        user with the calculations needed to maintain the history data. </p>
                    <h2><strong>What is Encapsulation?</strong></h2>
                    <p>It is a group of properties and members under a single class or Object. Programs can be really
                        long and there can easily be a ton of moving parts in it. After some time it gets really tough
                        to maintain all these objects without them running into complexity.</p>
                    <p>This is where a primary principle like encapsulation comes into play. You can use this principle
                        to encapsulate a set of objects into different classes. With this principle, you can prevent the
                        repetition of code and also shorten the length of your code. You can look at encapsulation like
                        a medicinal pill. All the medicine(Objects) are stored inside a pill (class) and you can consume
                        it whenever needed.</p>
                    <p>An example of encapsulation in the calculator program is creating an instance of the history class within calculations. No matter how many History objects are instantiated, each object will maintain a unique history of the calculations for a particular instance. In the code above, we see that the history class is instantiated for every instance of a calculation object, so we know that each calculation object has encapsulated history data associated with it.</p>
                    <h2><strong>What is Inheritance?</strong></h2>
                    <p>It is the ability to acquire the properties of existing classes and create new ones. Inheritance
                        allows you to reuse code without having to rewrite it in a program. One of the best features of
                        Inheritance is the ability to shorten the code in a program. You can use this principle to
                        inherit codes from another class and reuse it in a new class.</p>
                    <p>An example of inherited code in the calculator program can be the opening of CSV's. Because this code is common, it can be inherited by both csv writer and reader classes </p>
                    <h2><strong>What is Polymorphism?</strong></h2>
                    <p>Polymorphism refers to one name with many forms. It is the ability of one function to perform in
                        different ways. In other words, it refers to an object’s ability to take on more than one single
                        form.</p>
